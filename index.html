  This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model
  from a heterogenous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to acheive greater
  incremental improvement in accuracy, comparted to using a single type of classification model
  throughout the process. The startegy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further consider an
  application to texture classification problems un sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
  active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

<pre id="Introduction_InText">
  
  The idea of colonising habitable exoplanets has captured the imagination of scientists, futurists, and the public  
  alike. This ambitious venture holds the promise of securing humanity's future, spreading civilization beyond Earth, 
  and possibly discovering new forms of life. However, it also brings forth a multitude of environmental challenges 
  that must be carefully considered. 

  The introduction of Earth-based organisms to these environments poses a serious risk of ecological disruption. Based 
  on our own experience on Earth, the potential for polluting or depleting the planet's resources is high. Ethical 
  stewardship of these new worlds requires a deep consideration of our responsibility to preserve and protect 
  extraterrestrial environments.

  One issue we may face when settling on a new planet is our disruption to any local ecosystems. Without conducting
  sufficient research and experiments on indigenous ecology, our introduction to the planet has the potential for 
  profound disruption and ecological transformation. 

  <img width="300" height="300" alt="Picture1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae723b89-7a6b-40d6-814f-650e76131314" />

  If we were to look at our home planet of earth, we can see that the transformations of ecosystems have seen a rapid 
  increase in the second half of the 20th century. Probably the most notable change has been the shift of forests and 
  grassland into cropland and the loss of mangrove and coral reef areas. In addition, there has been an evident change 
  in the environmental cycles of water, nitrogen carbon and phosphorus which provide significant benefits to all life-forms.
  Without a doubt, the acceleration in technological advancement has aided  the harm to our very own ecosystem. So, this 
  begs the question, what will our ‘harmful’ technology do to the ecological landscape of a potentially different planet 
  with potentially different ecosystems?

  However, it is not only technology that may cause irreversible disruption but the very introduction of earth organisms 
  onto a new planet. With us we may be carrying various different pathogens and bacteria that serve as a direct threat to 
  the exoplanets' ecosystems. Moreover, the ecology of some planets may not be able to withstand our natural way of living, 
  the amount of travel, the building of  infrastructure and our food and water consumption. This may cause the planet to 
  transform in a way that makes the damages irreversible and encourages a cycle of settling and destroying new planets.

  <h3 id="Climate Change">Climate Change</h3>

<p class="ex1">
<pre id="ClimateChange_InText">

  Human activities on exoplanets has the potential to trigger significant alterations in climate patterns, with detrimental 
  consequences to the local environment and the potential habitability of these alien worlds. Although modifications to the 
  climate may provide benefits such as better habitability and improved conditions for human settlement it has the equal 
  potential to do the exact opposite.

  Some may think that by encouraging climate change to take its course we would be able to prevent extreme environmental conditions. 
  For example, a Neptune-like exoplanet, WASP-107b, has a naturally cloudy weather, which is prone to silicate rain showers and 
  sandstorms high in the planet's atmosphere. Therefore intentional climate change can help modulate unknown climates and may even 
  regulate the composition of the atmosphere by mitigating potentially harmful gases and chemicals. 

  Furthermore, deliberate climate modification can help facilitate the development of infrastructure and habitats that support human 
  settlement. Stable and predictable weather conditions will mean that it will be easier to design and build infrastructure that is 
  better suited to withstand challenging environmental conditions, promoting sustainable communities and permitting long-term human 
  presence on exoplanets. 
  
  However, even though we have the means to create safe and secure settlements on these planets we, as humans, also have the power to 
  destroy that just as quickly. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide on earth has increased by ⅓ since 1750 . If something 
  like this were to happen on a foreign planet, it could not only lead to significant manipulation and unforeseen ecological disruption 
  to natural processes that harm indigenous life. But, ruin the long-term sustainability that is crucial to our survival through space.

<p class="ex1">
<pre id="WasteManagement_InText">

  Waste management also emerges as a significant ethical consideration in space colonisation efforts looking at both the accumulation of 
  human-made space debris and the need for implementation of specific space management to help mitigate environmental damages. 
  
  The accumulation of debris poses a real dangerous threat to space exploration and the local environment. In space, floating debris presents 
  hazards to spacecraft, satellites and astronauts increasing catastrophic collisions and detrimental damage. For example, let’s take 
  The Kessler Syndrome, a phenomenon proposed by Donald J. Kessler in 1978, where he states that the amount of junk in orbit around Earth 
  reaches a point where it just creates more and more space debris.  In a study, titled <a href="#ref1">"Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The 
  Creation of a Debris Belt," by Kessler and co-author Burton Cour-Palais (1978)</a> shared that the frequency of satellite collisions increases 
  as more and more spacecraft are brought into orbit, each collision causing an enormous impact on the orbital environment.
  
  “Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the 
  growth of a belt of debris around the Earth," the duo wrote. "The debris flux in such an Earth-orbiting belt could exceed the natural meteoroid 
  flux, affecting future spacecraft designs.”
  
  Addressing these challenges requires the development of ethical waste management practices, which must include both the prevention of waste 
  production and the responsible disposal of waste materials. It is essential that we look at ethical waste management practices that have 
  considerations of intergenerational equity and responsibility.

<p class="ex1">
<pre id="Conclusion_InText">

  The environmental challenges associated with colonising habitable exoplanets, while significant, do not outweigh the potential benefits of such
  an endeavour. Instead, these challenges underscore the necessity for careful ethical reflection, responsible decision-making, and proactive 
  measures. 
  
  Addressing the environmental impact of colonising exoplanets requires stringent protocols to prevent ecological disruption and preserve 
  extraterrestrial environments. By prioritising environmental stewardship, humanity can mitigate the risks of harming pristine ecosystems and ensure 
  that our exploration efforts are conducted responsibly.
  
  Thus, the environmental challenges of colonising exoplanets emphasise the need for a conscientious approach, ensuring that space exploration proceeds 
  in a manner that is sustainable for all life.
